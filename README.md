AI-Powered Mutual Fund Portfolio Analysis & Investment Tracking System

**1. Project Overview**

The AI-Powered Mutual Fund Portfolio Analysis & Investment Tracking System is a microservices-based application that helps users manage and analyze their mutual fund investments.

The system allows users to track investments, monitor NAV, calculate profit/loss and returns, analyze portfolio risk, compare mutual funds, and identify performance gaps.

Note: The current project does not use Machine Learning. The term "AI-Powered" can be replaced with "Smart" if required.

**2. Objectives**

Track mutual fund investments and transactions.
Monitor NAV and portfolio value.
Calculate returns and profit/loss.
Analyze portfolio risk and diversification.
Compare different mutual funds.
Identify underperforming funds.
Provide a centralized portfolio dashboard.
Demonstrate Microservices and SOA architecture.
